                    <p>Kotlin is a modern and concise programming language developed by JetBrains and released in 2011. It is fully interoperable with Java and has gained popularity as the official language for Android application development. Kotlin is characterized by its clear and concise syntax, its null-safety, and its compatibility with multiple platforms, including server-side, web, and multiplatform applications.</p>

                    <p>The Kotlin programming language was originally designed to improve the Java programming language and is often used in conjunction with Java. Despite being the preferred development language of Android, Kotlin's interoperability with Java has led it to be used with many application types.</p>
                    <p>What is Kotlin used for?<br>
                        Kotlin is a general-purpose development language used mainly for Android mobile app development.</p>

            <div class="text-box">
                <p><strong>val:</strong> Declares a read-only variable (similar to <code>final</code> in Java). For example, <code>val name = "Kotlin"</code> declares a variable <code>name</code> whose value cannot be changed.</p>
                <p><strong>var:</strong> Declares a mutable variable that can be reassigned. For example, <code>var age = 25</code> allows the value of <code>age</code> to be changed at any time.</p>
                <p><strong>fun:</strong> Used to declare functions in Kotlin. For example, <code>fun greet() { println("Hello, World") }</code> declares a function that prints "Hello, World".</p>
                <p><strong>data class:</strong> Defines a data class that is used to store data. For example, <code>data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)</code> creates a class with predefined properties.</p>
                <p><strong>when:</strong> An alternative to <code>switch</code> in other languages, used to control the flow of the program. For example, <code>when (x) { 1 -> println("One") }</code>.</p>

                        <h3>Conclusion by José De la barra Urquieta</h3>
                        <p>Kotlin is a language that offers a perfect mix of simplicity and advanced functionality. Thanks to its interoperability with Java, it is a natural choice for developers who already have experience with that language and are looking for a more modern way to code. I would recommend Kotlin for anyone interested in Android app development, as it makes the development process easier and improves code readability.</p>

                        <h3>Conclusion by Alex Loza Donalson</h3>
                        <p>From my perspective, Kotlin is a language that has ushered in a new era of development for Android. Its concise syntax and advanced features, such as extension functions and data classes, make it superior to Java in many ways. Additionally, its ability to be multiplatform makes it ideal for projects looking to cover multiple devices. I consider it an essential tool for modern software development.</p>
